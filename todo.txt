fix
- remove scrollbar from popup signal editor and move the div down slightly
- hide the system prompt portion

if there is time UI features
- edit prior prommpts

generate a first set of data problems not too large to test db function mem0 calls
do we want to also have a link there to view context summary and gain other insights in that area... could be scrollable
