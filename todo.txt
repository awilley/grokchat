fix
- the sidebar search needs to be for the thread name
- remove scrollbar from popup signal editor and move the div down slightly

UI / UX
- dynamic context chips as prompt is typed
- user can click + to add context tag chips
- ability for user to make new focus mesh
- hide the system prompt portion

if there is time UI features
- edit / delete prior prommpts
- show context length used

generate a first set of data problems not too large to test db function mem0 calls
do we want to also have a link there to view context summary and gain other insights in that area... could be scrollable


future tools integration:
- context detection and automatic suggestions for creating new context signals
- tools for managing persona context
- tool for grok to automaticall
