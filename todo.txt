work UI / UX until 12:15
- dynamic context chips as prompt is typed
- user can click + to add context tag chips
- on existing promts user can click edit to edits tags

for signals within a category we want to let the user add remove edit these signals which are used to aid in the context detection and dynamic filtering
we want to also have a link there to view context summary and gain other insights in that area... could be scrollable


future tools integration:
- context detection and automatic suggestions for creating new context signals
- tools for managing persona context
-
